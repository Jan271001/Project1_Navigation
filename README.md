# Project1_Navigation
The first project in the udacity deep-reinforcement-learning nanodegree

## The Task
This Github repository is designed to solve an environment similar (but not identical!) to the Unity-Banana-Collector environment.

## The Environment
The agent in this repository is designed to navigate and collect bananas in a large square world. A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a 
reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas. 
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this 
information, the agent learned how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to

*0 = move forward.*

*1 = move backward.*

*2 = turn left.*

*3 = turn right.*

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must reach an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Getting started
Before runing the code in the jupyter-notebook make sure to install the necessary libraries. If you'd like to install them on your own machine please follow the instructions below. These instructions implay that your machine allready satisfys conditions to run jupyter notebooks and python3-code.
